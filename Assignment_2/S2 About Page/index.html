        Sky VR was founded in 2016 as a way to practice public speaking in a
        more realistic way. We had a fear
        <br />
        of public speaking to the point of avoiding it altogether, and found
        that rehearsing in front of a mirror or to a
        <br />
        colleague didn&#039;t prepare us for being on stage with hundreds of
        people staring at you, or even just being in a
        <br />
        meeting with our managers.
        <br />
        <br />
        We came up with a solution - using virtual reality (VR) to simulate
        various sized audiences and distractions,
        <br />
        resulting in an effective way to practice public speaking and build
        skills and confidence for the real world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, we have expanded into other soft skills training, from sales
        pitching to interacting with the media,
        <br />
        and worked with a number of Fortune 500 companies to enhance their
        employees&#039; soft skills in a more
        <br />
        interactive, engaging way.
